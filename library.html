  <h2>Book Reviews of Recent Reads</h2>

    <p> <strong>Creation by Gore Vidal - 4 Stars </strong> <br> Gore Vidal’s Creation is a beautiful 600-paged historical epic set during the axial age. I recommend this book to all that are attracted to ancient history and specifically the east. It follows the travels of Cyrus Spitama as he travels the eastern world as an ambassador of the Achaemenid Empire. The reason why it deserved 4 stars not 5 is because it’s incredibly broad and tries to compile multiple empires, wars, and kings into 600 pages and because it is incredibly hard to keep track of character names. I think Gore Vidal is an incredible historian and I will check out more of his books, most likely Justinian, which is his most famous and highly recommended across the interent.

      <p> <strong>Mysteries in History by Paul D. Aron - 5 Stars </strong> I absolutely adore this book. It's a collection of short stories of historical mysteries: Who built stonehendge, Why did Constaniople fall, etc... I have learned so much from this book and it was so gratifying to read a short story before sleep. It made me question everything because I would have never knew that half of the stories in the book were even mysteries; I had belived that these were established facts. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries and want to do something other than scrolling shorts before sleep.

  <p> <strong>Crisis of Democratic Capitalism by Martin Wolf - 3 stars </strong><br> I must confess that this book is more of an impulse buy; I couldn't find anything else at the library so I picked this one. The book is about the decline of democracy and rise of despots and dictators. It also talks about the symbiotic relationship between Democracy and Capitalism, and how in the long run one cannot exist without the other It's a fine book about political science, but not great. Martin Wolf does harbor some bias because he is the Cheif Economist at the Financial Times, a left-leaning British newspaper. If you can overlook some of his Anti-American sentiments and his poltical views, the book is a great read. </p>

  <p><strong> Money Changes Everything by William N. Goetzmann - 5 Stars </strong><br> Goetzmann's Money Changes Everything is a great book on the history of money and finance. It's incredibly interesting and very fun to read. One of the most interesting things I've learned from the books is how the idea of interest formed in the ancient near east and how the knights of templar became Europe's largest financial instituion during the middle ages. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in history or finance.  </p>

  <p> <strong>Is God a Mathematican? by Mario Livio - 3 Stars </strong><br>
  Despite the wealth of knowledge, the book missed the mark. The author doesn't even bother to answer the question and it's basically just a book on the history of mathermatics and methaphysics, or how do we know what we know. I wish Livio was more straightforward and answered the question "Is God A Mathemantician?" or even just answer how and why Math is so remarkably good at describing the world. I think he should have just titled the book "5000 years of Math" because that's what it is: the history of mathematics. I still slightly love this book; it has just stuck with me because it's the first book I read that goes deeply into the history of Mathematics. </p>

  <p><strong> Makers and Takers by Rana Foroohar - 1 Star</strong> <br> Foroohar's Makers and Takers might the worst book on Finance ever written. The book is just complete propaganda about financilization and wall street profit chasing. It teachs you absolutely nothing. The only interesting thing was when she added anocdates and inside conversations with big names like Carl Ichan, since she is a news reporter for CNN. For some reason she also thinks the use of optomization and statstics by businesses is awful also. </p>

  <br>
  
  <p><strong> After Steve by Trippe Mickle - 4.5 Stars</strong> <br>
  Mickle's After Steve is deep analysis of Apple as a company; it's past, present, and future. It's equal parts knowledgable and interesting. After reading the book, I had a very deep idea of Apple and each person that has come to build it to the behomth it is today. For example, you learn about the odd life of Tim Cook; how he grew up in some rural town, how he met Steve Jobs, his life before Apple, and him coming out as gay. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in business or just want something interesting to read.  </p>

  <br>

  <p><strong> The Thin Green Line by Paul Sulivan - 1 Star </strong><br> Anoter book that claims to be an introduction, but ends up teaching you nothing. The book is supposed to be about financial planning to how to grow wealthy and manage your money, but the book does an awful job at this. Most people already know about bucketing, using index funds, and debt = bad. This book will teach nothing you didn't already know and is a waste of your time. </p>

  <p><strong> Linux for Dummies by Richard Blum - 3 Stars <br> Blum's Linux for Dummies is an alright tutorial for learning about GNU/Linux. It just wasn't for me. It's mostly for folks who are trying to get accrideted for linux and passing the test. It's also very old and doesn't even seem to mention newer linux distros like Arch. But I did learn some things like why some people call it GNU/Linux and the basic command system.<strong></p>

    <p><strong> Subscribed by Tien Tzuo - -1 Stars <br> Awful awful book. The first 30 pages was Tien Tzuo talking about the important of subscriptions to create recurring revenue, revenue that will exist no matter what happens. The next 200 pages was him just giving examples for each and every industry. This was maybe the first book that I have owned that I haven't finished start to finish. It is a complete waste of time and you should maybe read it if that is what you want. The entire book could have been just 1 page.<strong></p>
